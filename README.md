## WELCOME:
This is the README.md for Our Team Project  titled: <i>Movie Finder</i>

Motivation for development- Searched for API’s from the list and found 2 API’s that would be sufficient for this project, hence came up with the idea. Used google as well.

We are making an app that recommends movies based on the genre.

## DESCRIPTION:
Search for movies.
View movie details- Plot, Genre, Actors, Release Year, and IMDB Rating.
View Trailer.
View Searched movies in History.

## USERSTORY
 As a user, I want to be able to search for movies by entering their titles in the search bar.
